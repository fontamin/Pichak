# Pichak
a set of non-textual pattern fonts created to use within graphic layouts

## Pichack#7
### About
This pattern font is based on an image of tilework from a mosque that I found via Google. Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to find reliable information about the exact location, date, or origin of the original tiles.

I used the image purely as a visual reference and attempted to extract its underlying pattern logic. Based on that analysis, I reconstructed the repeating structure and designed additional segments myself, including the beginning and middle parts, adapting them to be visually consistent with the original motif.

The result is not a direct reproduction, but an interpretive reconstruction and extension of the pattern, translated into a non-textual pattern colored font intended for use within graphic layouts.

### How to:
As shown in the image, the pattern can be constructed by typing and repeating any desired working arrangement of the characters (<+>)
